// Hi Alex!

// Declare a variable 'number' and set it to the value 10.

    /*
    Create a function 'addNumbers' that takes a number as an argument. 'addNumbers' should add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function.
    For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

    /*
    Create a function "between50And500" that takes a number as an argument.
    "between50And500" should return a true if the number passed to it is between 50 and 500 exclusive.
    For example, if the input is 45 then your function should return false and if the input is 472 it should return true.
    */
    
    /*
    Create a function "divBy100" that takes a number as an argument.
    "divBy100" should return a true if the number passed to it is divisible by 100.
    For example, if the input is 120 then your function should return false and if the input is 600 it should return true.

    /*
    Create a function "negativeOrEven" that takes a number as an argument.
    "negativeOrEven" should return a true if the number passed to it is a negative number OR it is an even number.
    For example, if the input is 7 then your function should return false and if the input is -3 it should return true.

    Create a function "passAllTests" that takes an array of functions and another value as arguments.
    Each function in your array will return a boolean value. "passAllTests" should pass your value argument to each function.
    If all functions in your array return true then "passAllTests" will return true. Otherwise "passAllTests" should return false

    Use your "passAllTests" function to test if the number 300 is greater than the number 50 and less than the number 500,
