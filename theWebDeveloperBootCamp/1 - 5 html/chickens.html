The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird.
A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon.
</p>
The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird,
but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.

<p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
    pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle),
    which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed.
    However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers,
    the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb,
    or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids,
    the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads
    called a comb,
    or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively,
    these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and
    female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation
    found
    in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.
    Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
    flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).
    Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived
    danger.</p>
